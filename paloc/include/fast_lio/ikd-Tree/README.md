# ikd-Tree
**ikd-Tree** is an incremental k-d tree designed for robotic applications. The ikd-Tree incrementally updates a k-d tree with new coming points only, leading to much lower computation time than existing static k-d trees. Besides point-wise operations, the ikd-Tree supports several features such as box-wise operations and down-sampling that are practically useful in robotic applications.

## What does ikd-Tree support?

- Build a balanced k-d tree - `Build()`

- Dynamically insert points to or delete points from the k-d tree - `Add_Points() / Delete_Points()`

- Delete points inside given axis-aligned bounding boxes - `Delete_Point_Boxes()`

- K Nearest Neighbor Search with range limitation - `Nearest_Search()`

- Acquire points insde a given axis-aligned bounding box on the k-d tree - `Box_Search()`

- Acquire points inside a ball with given radius on the k-d tree - `Radius_Search()`

## Build & Run demo
### 1. How to build this project
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:hku-mars/ikd-Tree.git
cd ikd-Tree/build
cmake ..
make -j 9
```
### 2. Run our examples

**Note: To run Example 2 & 3, please download the PCD file ([HKU_demo_pointcloud](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tMYiBIFn-fcjisaoIrmIKA09NICGG9KJ/view?usp=sharing))  into`${Your own directory}/ikd-Tree/materials`**

```bash
cd ${Your own directory}/ikd-Tree/build
# Example 1. Check the speed of ikd-Tree
./ikd_tree_demo
# Example 2. Searching-points-by-box examples
./ikd_Tree_Search_demo
# Example 3. An aysnc. exmaple for readers' better understanding of the principle of ikd-Tree
./ikd_tree_async_demo
```

**Example 2: ikd_tree_Search_demo** 

Box Search Result  |   Radius Search Result
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](materials/imgs/Box_Search.png) |  ![](materials/imgs/Radius_Search.png)

Points returned from the two search methods are shown in red.

**Example 3: ikd_tree_Async_demo**

Original Map:

Box Delete Results:

Points removed from ikd-Tree(red) |       Map after box delete        
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](materials/imgs/removed.png) |  ![](materials/imgs/remain.png)

This example is to demonstrate the asynchronous phenomenon in ikd-Tree. The points are deleted by attaching 'deleted' on the tree nodes (map shown in the ) instead of being removed from the ikd-Tree immediately. They are removed from the tree when rebuilding process is performed. Please refer to our paper for more details about delete and rebuilding.
