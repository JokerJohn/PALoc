## Introduction

Accurately generating ground truth (GT) trajectories is essential for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) evaluation, particularly under varying environmental conditions. This study introduces a systematic approach employing a prior map-assisted framework for generating dense six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) GT poses for the first timeï¼Œ enhancing the fidelity of both indoor and outdoor SLAM datasets. Our method excels in handling degenerate and stationary conditions frequently encountered in SLAM datasets, thereby increasing robustness and precision. A significant aspect of our approach is the detailed derivation of covariances within the factor graph, enabling an in-depth analysis of pose uncertainty propagation. This analysis crucially contributes to demonstrating specific pose uncertainties and enhancing trajectory reliability from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Additionally, we provide an [open-source toolbox](https://github.com/JokerJohn/Cloud_Map_Evaluation) for map evaluation criteria, facilitating the indirect assessment of overall trajectory precision.  Experimental results show at least a 30\% improvement in map accuracy and a 20\% increase in direct trajectory accuracy compared to the Iterative Closest Point (ICP)  algorithm across diverse campus environments, with substantially enhanced robustness. Our open-source solution, extensively applied in the FusionPortable  dataset, is geared towards SLAM benchmark dataset augmentation and represents a significant advancement in SLAM evaluations.
